## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-16

A minor bump rather than a patch: your `config.toml` is now read strictly and
never silently replaced, and the GUI↔agent protocol moved to v17. Both change
observable behaviour, so they do not belong in a patch release.

### Highlights

- **Your config is no longer silently discarded.** A malformed, hand-edited, or
  future-schema `config.toml` used to fall back to defaults without saying so —
  losing every binding in it. It is now parsed strictly (unknown, obsolete, and
  out-of-range fields are rejected with the file path and TOML location), and
  the failure is shown in the window instead of being papered over. Saves keep
  your comments and formatting, and a file edited behind OpenLogi's back is
  refused rather than overwritten.
- **Mice and keyboards that speak only the newer HID++ features work now.** A
  mouse exposing `0x2202 ExtendedAdjustableDpi` without the older `0x2201` used
  to get a DPI panel where every read and write failed; a keyboard exposing
  `0x8081 PerKeyLighting2` without `0x8080` got no lighting tab at all. Both are
  driven properly. ([#629](https://github.com/AprilNEA/OpenLogi/pull/629))
- **The Actions Ring is reliable under repeat use.** Haptics no longer fire from
  a retired session, a stale feature handle can no longer be reused across a
  reconnect, and the ring stays alive as long as it is clickable.
  ([#596](https://github.com/AprilNEA/OpenLogi/pull/596),
  [#597](https://github.com/AprilNEA/OpenLogi/pull/597),
  [#598](https://github.com/AprilNEA/OpenLogi/pull/598),
  [#599](https://github.com/AprilNEA/OpenLogi/pull/599))
- **Windows camera control stops leaking.** Every COM and Media Foundation
  initialization is now paired with its release, and a UVC entity scan stays
  inside its own VideoControl block instead of walking into a neighbour's.

### Upgrade notes

- `schema_version` is `4`; v1–v4 configs still migrate automatically. A config
  that fails to parse now surfaces an error rather than resetting to defaults —
  see [Editing and recovery](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) if OpenLogi reports one.
  `docs/config.example.toml` is a tested canonical example.
- The GUI and agent negotiate protocol v17. A stale agent left running from an
  older install is detected and replaced; no action is needed.
