//! OS-level mouse-event hook for OpenLogi.
//!
//! | Platform | Implementation |
//! |----------|---------------|
//! | macOS    | `CGEventTap` (same primitive used by Logi Options+) |
//! | Linux    | `evdev` grab + `uinput` re-injection |
//! | Windows  | `WH_MOUSE_LL` low-level mouse hook (motion is edge-clamped) |
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use openlogi_hook::{Hook, MouseEvent, EventDisposition};
//!
//! if !Hook::has_accessibility() {
//!     eprintln!("grant Accessibility access first");
//!     return;
//! }
//!
//! let hook = Hook::start(|event| {
//!     println!("{event:?}");
//!     EventDisposition::PassThrough
//! }).unwrap();
//!
//! // … later, on shutdown:
//! hook.stop();
//! ```
