//! - **Brand / status** colours are fixed `u32` constants. They're saturated
//!   enough to read on both light and dark backgrounds, so they don't change
//!   with the OS appearance (the OpenLogi accent blue, the connectivity dots).
//! - **Surface / text** colours flip with the appearance and live in
//!   [`Palette`], chosen by [`palette`] from the active gpui-component theme
//!   mode. The bespoke surfaces (window, cards, mouse model)
//!   read these so they track the same light/dark switch as gpui-component's
//!   own widgets — which is what keeps a popover from rendering white under
//!   an otherwise dark UI (see `main.rs`'s appearance wiring).
