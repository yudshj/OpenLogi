//! Implements basic messaging across HID and HID++ channels.
//!
//! This includes mapping incoming messages to previously sent requests. A
//! reply is matched to the oldest pending request whose predicate accepts it,
//! and every predicate keys on the report's first three bytes — device,
//! feature (or HID++1.0 sub id), function and software id (or register
//! address). Two requests sharing those bytes therefore get replies nothing on
//! the wire can tell apart, and a wireless receiver may answer them out of
//! order (a retransmitted radio packet completes after a later one). The
//! channel never lets that happen: a request whose key is already in flight
//! waits until that request is answered — or, when it timed out or was
//! cancelled unanswered, until its reply lands and is discarded or
//! [`STALE_REPLY_GRACE`] passes without one. That holds even for a request
//! that re-asks the abandoned one byte for byte — the same question does not
//! promise the same answer once a write has gone between them — unless the
//! caller says otherwise with [`AbandonedReply::AdoptIdentical`], which only
//! a query of immutable state may.
