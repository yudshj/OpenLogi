//! An implementation of Logitech's HID++ protocol.
//!
//! Many of Logitech's more modern peripheral devices (mice, keyboards etc.)
//! support advanced features improving the user experience. These include, but
//! are not limited to, things like:
//!
//! - scroll wheels dynamically switching between ratchet and freespin mode ([SmartShift](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052340194-What-is-SmartShift-on-MX-Anywhere-3))
//! - [mouse gestures](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023359813-How-to-customize-mouse-buttons-with-Logitech-Options#gesture)
//! - custom actions for specific mouse buttons
//! - several customizability options for keyboards, audio devices and touchpads
//!
//! All of these features can be managed using their (more or less) proprietary
//! HID++-protocol which extends standard [HID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_device).
//!
//! Logitech kindly provided a [public Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BxbRzx7vEV7eWmgwazJ3NUFfQ28)
//! with a lot of documentation on HID++ and several device features. These
//! documents were heavily used during the development of this crate.
//!
//! I also made use of the excellent work already done by the
//! [Solaar](https://github.com/pwr-Solaar/Solaar) team to grow my
//! understanding of how things work. It's a great project perfectly usable to
//! configure Logitech devices on Linux, so definitely check it out if you are
//! looking for something like this.
//!
//! # Quickstart
//!
//! ## Establish HID communication
//!
//! This crate implements the HID++ protocol, not the underlying [HID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_device)
//! communication, which is left to an external crate of your choice.
//! The trait used for bridging your HID implementation to this crate is
//! [`channel::RawHidChannel`], so make sure to provide an implementation for
//! it. The trait defines async methods using [`mod@async_trait`], which is
//! re-exported for annotating your implementing type.
//!
//! The crate primarily used while testing and developing is [`async-hid`](https://crates.io/crates/async-hid).
//! Providing an implementation for this crate behind a feature gate is
//! planned and will be implemented once [retrieving the raw report descriptor](https://github.com/sidit77/async-hid/issues/17)
//! is supported.
//!
//! ## Initialize HID++ communication
//!
//! Once you have a working implementation of [`channel::RawHidChannel`], you
//! can start by creating a [`channel::HidppChannel`]:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//!
//! use hidpp::{
//!     channel::{HidppChannel, SwIdPolicy},
//!     device::Device,
//!     feature::{
//!        CreatableFeature,
//!        EmittingFeature,
//!        feature_set::v0::FeatureSetFeatureV0,
//!        thumbwheel::v0::{ThumbwheelEvent, ThumbwheelFeatureV0, ThumbwheelReportingMode},
//!    },
//!    nibble::U4,
//!    receiver::{self, Receiver, bolt::BoltEvent},
//! };
//!
//! // First, we will create the HID++ channel.
//! // This function will return `ChannelError::HidppNotSupported`
//! // if the passed HID channel does not support HID++.
//! let mut channel = HidppChannel::from_raw_channel(my_hid_channel)
//!     .await
//!     .expect("could not establish HID++ communication");
//!
//! // HID++2.0 includes an arbitrary "software ID" in every message, used to
//! // map responses back to requests. The channel's policy decides it per
//! // request: `Fixed` (the default, id 1), `Rotating` (one id per request),
//! // or `Leased` (a fixed id held for the channel's lifetime and handed
//! // back on drop, for concurrent opens of one node). Decide the policy
//! // while the channel is still exclusively owned, then share it.
//! channel.set_sw_id_policy(SwIdPolicy::rotating());
//! let channel = Arc::new(channel);
//!
//! // If a wireless receiver is handling the HID++ communication,
//! // we can detect it.
//! let receiver = receiver::detect(Arc::clone(&channel)).expect("no receiver
//! was found");
//!
//! // Assuming we have a Bolt receiver, we will now detect all connected
//! devices. let Receiver::Bolt(bolt) = receiver else {
//!     panic!("no Bolt receiver");
//! };
//! tokio::spawn({
//!     let rx = bolt.listen();
//!
//!     async move {
//!         while let Ok(BoltEvent::DeviceConnection(event)) = rx.recv() {
//!             println!("Paired device found: {:x?}", event);
//!         }
//!     }
//! });
//! bolt.trigger_device_arrival()
//!     .await
//!     .expect("could not trigger device arrival notification");
//!
//! // Let's say we found a device with the index 0x02 using this enumeration.
//! We can now initialize it:
//! let mut device = Device::new(Arc::clone(&channel), 0x02)
//!     .await
//!     .expect("could not initialize device");
//!
//! // The device is a HID++2.0 one, meaning it supports so-called HID++2.0
//! // features. Every device supports the standardized `IRoot` feature, which
//! // we can access like this:
//! let root = device.root();
//! assert_eq!(0x2, root.ping(0x2).await.unwrap());
//!
//! // Additional features are accessed by their feature index in the
//! // device-internal feature map, not by their globally unique feature ID.
//! // The root feature also supports looking up a specific feature by its ID.
//! // The resulting value will contain some information about the feature,
//! // including its index:
//! let info = root
//!     .get_feature(FeatureSetFeatureV0::ID)
//!     .await
//!     .expect("could not look up feature")
//!     .expect("FeatureSet feature is not supported");
//!
//! // As there are a lot of possible features and a given device only supports
//! // a small subset of these, looking up every single feature ID using this
//! // technique is not practicable. That's why the `IFeatureSet` feature can be
//! // used to enumerate over all supported features, but only if this feature
//! // itself is supported by the device.
//! let infos = device
//!     .enumerate_features()
//!     .await
//!     .expect("could not look up features")
//!     .expect("FeatureSet feature is not supported");
//!
//! // This crate provides Rust implementations for many HID++2.0 features. A
//! // registry in the `hidpp::feature::registry` module maintains a list of all
//! // known features and, if provided, a link to its implementation. The
//! // `enumerate_features` function we just called automatically registers
//! // these implementations for our device and we can now access them like this:
//! let thumbwheel = device
//!     .get_feature::<ThumbwheelFeatureV0>()
//!     .expect("Thumbwheel feature is not supported");
//! thumbwheel
//!     .set_thumbwheel_reporting(ThumbwheelReportingMode::Diverted, false)
//!     .await
//!     .expect("could not divert thumbwheel");
//! ```
