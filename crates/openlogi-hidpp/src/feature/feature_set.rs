///
/// This feature is primarily used to collect all features supported by the
/// device. To achieve this, call [`Self::count`] to retrieve the amount of
/// supported features (excluding the root feature). Then call
/// [`Self::get_feature`] for every `i in 1..=count` (1-based, as accessing the
/// root feature is not allowed).
///
/// The table is fixed for the life of the connection: no write changes what
/// either function answers. Both therefore adopt a reply still owed to an
/// abandoned identical ask ([`AbandonedReply::AdoptIdentical`]), so a walk
/// that re-asks for an entry the link dropped is not held for the channel's
/// stale-reply grace on every retry — the one place that trade is sound.
