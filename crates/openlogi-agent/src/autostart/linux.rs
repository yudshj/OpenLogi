//! Linux systemd user-unit ownership and autostart reconciliation.
//!
//! When a packaged unit already launches this exact binary — installed by a
//! distribution package, `install.sh`, or an administrator — it is simply
//! enabled. Generating a second copy would duplicate its directives one tier
//! higher, shadowing later changes to it and outliving its removal, since no
//! package script can clean a home directory.
//!
//! Otherwise a systemd **user** unit at
//! `$XDG_DATA_HOME/systemd/user/openlogi-agent.service` (default
//! `~/.local/share/systemd/user/openlogi-agent.service`) is written/removed,
//! then `systemctl --user daemon-reload` and `enable`/`disable` are called.
//! That is the tier systemd reserves for units installed *on* a user's behalf;
//! `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/systemd/user` outranks it and belongs to the user, so a
//! unit they author by hand always wins over this generated one.
//! `Restart=on-failure` mirrors the macOS `KeepAlive=SuccessfulExit:false`
//! semantics. A clean `exit(0)` leaves the unit enabled but stopped until the
//! next session login.
//!
//! Neither user-writable tier is exclusively this app's, so nothing is written
//! over or deleted unless it round-trips through the renderer and is therefore
//! provably one of ours — including the file earlier versions wrote into
//! `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/systemd/user`, which is cleaned up on reconcile. A unit
//! anything else installed under the same name is left alone, and the setting
//! is honoured through enablement alone.
//!
//! Enablement is tracked separately, because `systemctl --user enable` records
//! only that a unit is enabled, never who asked. Without that record,
//! reconciling a disabled setting would withdraw the enablement made by the
//! documented `systemctl --user enable --now` install step. A marker beside the
//! config notes an enablement this app made; `disable` runs only against one.
