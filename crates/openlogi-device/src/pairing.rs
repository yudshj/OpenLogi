//! Wireless device pairing for Logi Bolt and Unifying receivers.
//!
//! The published `hidpp 0.2` can only *read* existing pairings, and its
//! `BoltReceiver` is closed to extension. So OpenLogi drives the receiver's
//! HID++ 1.0 registers directly over the public [`HidppChannel`] primitives,
//! the same way [`crate::write`] and [`crate::session::gesture`] bypass the crate's
//! higher-level abstractions.
//!
//! The register layout and notification framing below are reverse engineered
//! from Solaar (the authoritative open-source reference) and cross-checked
//! against `hidpp 0.2`'s own `0x41` device-connection parser. Two families,
//! two flows:
//!
//! - **Bolt** (`046d:c548`): open *discovery* → the receiver streams nearby
//!   unpaired devices → pick one → pair by its BTLE address → the device
//!   shows a *passkey* the user types (keyboard) or clicks (pointer) →
//!   success carries the assigned slot.
//! - **Unifying** (`046d:c52b`, `046d:c532`): open a pairing *lock*; the next
//!   powered-on unpaired device in range links on its own. No discovery list,
//!   no passkey.
//!
//! Drive a session with [`run_pairing`]: it streams [`PairingEvent`]s out and
//! takes [`PairingCommand`]s in (the Bolt device pick / cancel). [`unpair`]
//! removes a slot; [`list_pairing_receivers`] reports what's connectable.
