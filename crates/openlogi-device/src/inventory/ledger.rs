//! Per-node probe-health ledger for the [`crate::inventory::Enumerator`].
//!
//! A HID node that the OS still enumerates can stop answering HID++ — a
//! receiver register read times out, or the transport read loop parked on a
//! `Disconnected` handle (see `AsyncHidChannel::read_report`). Without this
//! ledger such a tick yields an empty/partial inventory that is
//! indistinguishable from "checked, no devices", so the GUI flaps between the
//! full device list and "No devices connected" (#218), and a parked channel —
//! which is only ever evicted when its node *vanishes* — wedges enumeration
//! until the agent is restarted.
//!
//! The ledger fixes both: while a node's probe fails it replays the node's
//! last completed inventory for a bounded grace, and after a couple of
//! consecutive failures it asks the enumerator to drop the node's cached
//! channel so the next tick reopens it fresh.
//!
//! Generic over the node key ([`crate::backend::NodeId`] in production) purely
//! so the decision table can be exercised with a trivial key, keeping the
//! tests about the replay policy rather than about node identity.
