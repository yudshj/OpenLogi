//! Opening the HID++ channel that reaches a [`DeviceRoute`].
//!
//! [`DeviceRoute`] itself is pure addressing data with no I/O — it lives in
//! `openlogi_core::hid::route` so the GUI can depend on it without linking
//! this crate's transport. This module re-exports it and adds
//! [`open_route_channel`]: both the write path ([`crate::write`]) and the
//! capture session ([`crate::session::gesture`]) resolve a route to an open channel
//! through it, so the Bolt-vs-direct branch lives in exactly one place.
