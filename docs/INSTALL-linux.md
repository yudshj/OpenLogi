# Installing OpenLogi on Linux

> [!NOTE]
> Linux support is in active development. HID++ device enumeration supports
> **Logi Bolt** (USB PID `0xC548`) and **Logi Unifying** (PID `0xC52B` and
> others) receivers, as well as Bluetooth-direct devices.

## Prerequisites

- **Quit Solaar** (or any other Logitech manager) before starting OpenLogi — the
  two applications fight over HID++ access.
- A kernel with `hidraw` and `uinput` module support (standard on all major
  distros).
- `systemd` + `udev` (standard on Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, Debian, openSUSE, …).
- GLIBC 2.35 or newer for the pre-built packages (Ubuntu 22.04 baseline).

## NixOS

The repository Flake provides a package and a NixOS module for x86_64 and
aarch64 Linux. Importing the module is preferred over adding the package to
`environment.systemPackages` by itself: the module also registers the udev
rules required for device access and manages the agent's user service.

```nix
{
  inputs.nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  inputs.openlogi = {
    url = "github:AprilNEA/OpenLogi";
    inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };

  outputs = { nixpkgs, openlogi, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.my-host = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "x86_64-linux"; # or aarch64-linux
      modules = [
        openlogi.nixosModules.default
        {
          programs.openlogi = {
            enable = true;
            # Starts openlogi-agent with graphical-session.target by default.
            launchAtLogin = true;
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

Set `programs.openlogi.launchAtLogin = false` to install the package and udev
rules without automatically starting the agent. It remains available as
`systemctl --user start openlogi-agent.service`.

For a build without installing the module:

```sh
nix build github:AprilNEA/OpenLogi#openlogi
```

## Build from source

Pre-built `.deb` and `.rpm` packages are available on the
[releases page](https://github.com/AprilNEA/OpenLogi/releases/latest) — see
the main [README](../README.md#linux) for the package-based install. To build
from source instead, use the stable Rust toolchain:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AprilNEA/OpenLogi
cd OpenLogi
cargo build --release -p openlogi -p openlogi-desktop -p openlogi-agent
```

Four production executables land in `target/release/`:

| Binary | Role |
|---|---|
| `openlogi` | CLI — inventory, diagnostics, asset sync |
| `openlogi-desktop` | Desktop GUI |
| `openlogi-overlay` | Actions Ring overlay helper |
| `openlogi-agent` | Background agent — HID++ loop, input hook |

## Device access: udev rules

OpenLogi needs:

- **Write access to `/dev/uinput`** — to create the virtual input device for
  button remapping.
- **Read/write access to `/dev/hidraw*`** — to send HID++ commands to the Bolt
  receiver, or to the device itself when it is paired over Bluetooth.
- **Read access to the mouse's `/dev/input/event*` node** — the hook grabs the
  pointer there to capture button presses. Bluetooth mice need the bundled rule
  for this: their event node hangs off `/devices/virtual/misc/uhid`, which has
  no seat, so `logind` never grants the ACL on its own.

Install the bundled udev rules to grant access to the active-seat user without
requiring `sudo` or group membership (requires `systemd-logind`):

```sh
sudo cp packaging/linux/udev/70-openlogi.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

Verify access (should open without error):

```sh
# Check uinput
openlogi-agent --check-uinput 2>/dev/null || \
    test -w /dev/uinput && echo "uinput OK"

# Check a hidraw node
ls -la /dev/hidraw*

# Check the mouse's event node — look for a "+" (ACL) in the mode, or your
# user in the ACL itself. Without it the agent logs
# "could not install OS mouse hook".
getfacl /dev/input/event*
```

The GUI Settings → Permissions page shows a live `Granted` / `Not granted`
indicator; check it after installing the rules (no restart needed).

> **Device already connected?** `udevadm trigger` re-evaluates rules but does
> not re-grant `uaccess` ACLs on nodes that were already open when the rules
> were installed. If access is still denied, unplug and replug your receiver or
> mouse (or power-cycle for wireless devices) to let udev apply the new rules on
> reconnect.

### Non-systemd systems (SysV init, OpenRC)

Replace `TAG+="uaccess"` in the rules file with `MODE="0660", GROUP="input"`,
then add your user to the `input` group:

```sh
sudo usermod -aG input "$USER"
# Re-login for the group change to take effect.
```

## Install with the script

The `packaging/linux/install.sh` script copies the binaries, udev rules,
systemd unit, desktop entry, and icon to system paths, then reloads `udevadm`.

```sh
# From the repo root, after building:
sudo packaging/linux/install.sh
# Or to a custom prefix (e.g. /usr):
packaging/linux/install.sh --prefix=/usr
```

To remove:

```sh
packaging/linux/uninstall.sh
```

## Autostart (launch at login)

The background agent (`openlogi-agent`) must be running for the GUI and CLI to
show connected devices. Enable it for your user session:

```sh
systemctl --user enable --now openlogi-agent.service
```

Alternatively, toggle **Settings → General → Launch at login** in the GUI. When
a packaged unit is already installed it simply enables that one. Otherwise — a
build from source, or an install under a custom prefix — it generates a unit at
`~/.local/share/systemd/user/openlogi-agent.service` pointing at the running
binary.

Either way `~/.config/systemd/user/openlogi-agent.service` stays yours: systemd
ranks it above both locations, so a unit you write there overrides whatever
OpenLogi does. Use `systemctl --user edit openlogi-agent.service` for a drop-in
that survives package upgrades.

OpenLogi never overwrites or deletes a unit it did not generate, at either
location, and it only turns off an autostart it turned on. Enabling the service
yourself with the command above keeps working regardless of the GUI toggle.

## Verify the installation

```sh
# List connected Logitech devices:
openlogi list

# Launch the GUI:
openlogi-desktop
```

## Known limitations

| Limitation | Status |
|---|---|
| Wayland: per-application profile switching | Requires XWayland (`WM_CLASS` lookup uses X11) |
| Button capture: middle / mode-shift / thumbwheel | Side buttons only today |
